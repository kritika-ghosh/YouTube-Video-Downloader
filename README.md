- **Error handling**: Alerts the user if the URL field is empty or if an error occurs during the download process.
- **Minimal design**: Compact GUI with intuitive controls.

#### Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed in your environment:

1. **Python 3.x**: Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **yt-dlp**: Install using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp
   ```
3. **customtkinter**: Install using pip:

#### How It Works

1. **Input field**: Accepts the YouTube video URL.
2. **Download function**: 
   - Utilizes the `YoutubeDL` class from the **yt-dlp** library to handle the video download.
   - If successful, shows a "Download complete" message.
   - If an error occurs, displays an error message.

---

#### Customization
You can customize the download options by modifying the `ydl_opts` dictionary. For example:

```python
ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'bestvideo+bestaudio',
    'outtmpl': 'downloads/%(title)s.%(ext)s',
}
```

---

#### Notes
- This application does not support downloading playlists by default. Modify the code to include playlist handling if required.
- Ensure proper permissions for the directory where videos will be downloaded.

---

#### Troubleshooting
- **Missing dependencies**: Install missing packages using pip.
- **Download errors**: Check your internet connection or ensure the URL is valid.
- **Permission issues**: Verify that the script has write permissions for the target directory.
